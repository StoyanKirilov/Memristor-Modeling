# Memristor Modeling in GNU Octave**
Here is presented a memristor library containing basic and commonly used standard memristor models and several modified by Prof. DSc. V. Mladenov and Assist. Prof. Dr. S. Kirilov memristor models. 
The offered models are suitable for simulations of single memristors and simple memristor-based circuits in GNU Octave in the domain. The models could be analyzed and their parameters could be altered by the users, according to different memristor nanostructures. GNU Octave is a user-friendly and free software for simulations and mathematical analyses.
In near future the suggested memristor library will be enriched by other and new models. 
# General information
Memristors are one-port passive and highly nonlinear electronic elements with memory and switching behavior - after switching the energy sources off they retain its conductance (resistance). Their resistance and respective state is altering by external current or voltage signals. In the library the considered memristor models are mainly related to transition metal oxide memristors - titanium oxide, hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide and others. Memristors are analyzed intensively in the latest years and they have potential applications in memory crossbars, reconfigurable digital and analog circuits, neural networks and many others.
# 1. Modeling of memristors in GNU Octave environment
For analysis of memristors and memristor circuits the interested readers have to use GNU Octave software. This software could be downloaded and installed visiting the following web address: https://octave.org/download 
# 2. Information for downloading and utilizing memristor models
First download the .zip file, unzip it and keep the derived folder. All the considered memristor models will be available in this folder. The readers must previously installed GNU Octave software. Open a given model with GNU Octave and then run it. The results and the respective figures will be derived after a short time.
# 3. Other circuit elements and memristor-based circuits
For additional information and comparisons, some commonly used circuit elements and simple circuits are also included.
# 4. Citation
When the interested readers use a given memristor model or simple circuit, please cite the original references shown in the end of the corresponding code.
